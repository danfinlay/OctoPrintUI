# OctoPrintUI

A Javascript Library for building custom OctoPrint interfaces.

Right now just getting set up.  Building a mock OctoPrint API server in the /test folder so I can have integration tests running as I develop.

The OctoPrint API documentation is [currently online here](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/).
